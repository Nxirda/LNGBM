#TO DO quickly :

    - commentary so code beacomes readable and has doc
    - make the code safe
    - benchmark and maybe improve computations
    - Fix MPI Wrapper 
    - Make it so we can specify number of values to split on (for H, RV etc)
    - verify every place where we use Nodes/Tree etc to use the move constructor if possible
    - move to add to trainingelement
